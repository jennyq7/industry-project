# Industry-project

This industry project was created as part of a Hackathon I participated in for Google at BrainStation.
The goal was to help Google make their services more accessible. 
We opted to make a modal appear on Google's homepage upon pressing the people icon. The Modal lets you choose a service based on your disability and it will then take you to the relevant page.

## Technologies:

React, HTML, CSS, SASS, react-router-dom

### What I learned:

I got the opportunity to work in a cross disciplinary team and I learned a bit about the work process of UX and Data Science fields. I did not know that you could add interactivity to Figma.

I also learned that the planning/brainstorming phase can take longer than expected but it was still interesting to hear ideas from other fields.
